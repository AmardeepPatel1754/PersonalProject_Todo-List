# Todo List App

A simple To-Do list application built with React that allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks, with data persistence using localStorage.


## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Input text to add a new task.
- **Complete/Uncomplete Tasks**: Toggle task completion by clicking the checkbox.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Data Persistence**: Tasks are saved in localStorage, so they persist between page refreshes.
